# How to Track AI Citations and Traffic

Want to know if your site is being referenced by ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or other AI systemsâ€”and if you're getting traffic from those citations? Here's how to do it, step by step.

---

## 1. Track Direct and Referral Traffic

- **Google Analytics / Plausible / Fathom:**
  - Monitor for spikes in direct traffic after content updates or AI optimizations.
  - Look for new referral sources (e.g., Perplexity may show up as a referrer).
  - For ChatGPT, look for "dark traffic" (direct visits to deep pages with no referrer).
- **UTM Parameters:**
  - Use UTM links when sharing your content in AI communities or tools to track click-throughs.

## 2. Monitor AI Platform Mentions

- **Manual Testing:**
  - Regularly ask ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity questions relevant to your content. See if your site is cited or recommended.
  - For Perplexity, check the "Sources" section of answers for your domain.
- **Google Alerts:**
  - Set up alerts for your brand/domain to catch new mentions on the web (sometimes AI-generated content is indexed).
- **Brand Monitoring Tools:**
  - Use [Mention](https://mention.com/) or [Brand24](https://brand24.com/) to track mentions of your brand or domain.

## 3. Advanced: Automated Monitoring

- **Perplexity API:**
  - Use the [Perplexity API](https://docs.perplexity.ai/) to programmatically check if your site is being cited as a source.
- **Custom Scripts:**
  - Scrape Perplexity or other AI platforms for your domain in the sources list (requires technical setup).

## 4. Attribution Best Practices

- **Add UTM parameters** to links you want to track.
- **Encourage citations** by providing quotable, well-structured content and clear source attribution.
- **Monitor analytics** for new patterns in direct/referral traffic.

**Tip:**
- If you see a sudden spike in direct traffic, check if your content was recently cited by an AI system or in an AI-generated answer.
- Keep a log of manual tests and citations for future reference.
