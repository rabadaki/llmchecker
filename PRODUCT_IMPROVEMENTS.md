   - Use DataForSEO and LLMs to generate content ideas focused on SEO and AI visibility.
   - Ideas are turned into draft blog posts (MDX files) following best practices (EEAT, schema, FAQ, etc.).
2. **Draft Generation (Automated):**
   - Drafts are saved as MDX files in `/src/app/blog/drafts/`.
   - Each draft includes all metadata and is formatted for the site.
3. **Review & Approval (Manual, via Web UI):**
   - Private page (e.g., `/blog/unpublished`) lists all drafts for review.
   - Users can preview, approve/publish, edit, or delete drafts from the UI.
4. **Publishing (Semi-Automated):**
   - On approval, draft is moved to `/src/app/blog/`, added to `posts-meta.ts`, and removed from `/drafts`.
   - Optionally, updates internal links and pillar content.
5. **(Optional) Notifications:**
   - Email or Slack notifications when new drafts are available.
6. **(Optional) Full Automation:**
   - Once trusted, agent can auto-publish on a schedule.

**Benefits:**
- No third-party tools required; everything stays in-app.
- Easy, user-friendly review and approval process.
- Automation + control: agent handles ideation/drafting, user controls publishing.
- Extensible for future features (search, filters, analytics, etc.).
